The zip file proj_api.zip contains a wrapper DLL for the PROJ.4 library.
See http://www.remotesensing.org/proj for information.

The primary purpose of this wrapper is to make certain functions available
for use in Visual Basic programs.  The DLL has been compiled against the
proj.dll version 4.4.6 distributed from the remotesensing.org site.  Earlier
or later versions may not work properly without recompilation.  Not all
functions will work in a desirable fashion from VB.  The wrapper was written
primarily to expose "pj_init_plus()", and "pj_transform".  Other functions
may not work correctly.  It is pretty much impossible to usefully use 
functions that return pointers to C strings or other objects in VB.  However,
if you only need the pointer to pass around, a VB Long will suffice.

An example coordinate calculator application is included as a Microsoft
Access database (example.mdb).
